# Interpretable-Classification-And-Out-Of-Distribution-Detection-Skin-Lesion-Images

- Proposed an EfficientNetV2B3-based CNN model, trained for skin lesion image classification with an accuracy of 88.55% on the HAM10000 Dataset.
- Implemented XAI techniques like GradCAM and GradCAM++ to explain the proposed model predictions.
- The proposed CNN was integrated with Deep Neural Decision Forest model to perform the out-of-distribution detection of unseen skin lesion classes with an AUROC of 79.14%.
